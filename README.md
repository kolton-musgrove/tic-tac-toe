# tic-tac-toe
A simple one-player tic-tac-toe game that I made in an hour and a half.


The computer in this version of tic-tac-toe lacks any kind of strategy and simply picks a random, abailable move. There are many pieces that can be improved upon. I simmply selectded the simplext option for each problem encountered. I will later come back and refine some of the ways the game is built.
